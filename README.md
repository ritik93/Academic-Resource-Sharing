# Academic-Resource-Sharing
Creating a Peer-to-Peer Academic Resource Sharing System

## Implementation
1. Two Peers are created, namely, Peer A and Peer B
2. On running both peerA.py and peerB.py it is asked that whether you want to act as a client or a server
3. When one peer acts a client and the other as a server
4. The client can then start sending the file to the server
5. peerA.py and peerB.py run infinitely until the user explicitly enters "EXIT"
